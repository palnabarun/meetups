Join us for our second Platform Engineering Meetup in Bangalore on 14th of September. This meetup is for platform engineers, cloud-native enthusiasts, DevOps professionals, and anyone looking to learn about these fields.

During this meetup, we will have technical talks from industry experts on various topics such as Internal Developer Platforms, Cloud Development Environments, latest trends in cloud-native tools and technologies, and DevOps best practices.

This is a great opportunity to network with like-minded individuals and learn from experienced professionals in the cloud-native landscape. We welcome all levels of expertise and backgrounds. So whether you're interested in learning more about platform engineering and cloud technologies or simply looking to connect with others in the industry, join us!

## Agenda

- 10:00 AM Introductions

- 10:30 AM Talk # 1

Title: Why We Chose To Build a Developer Platform on Top of Kubernetes

Abstract: A lot of organizations are looking to build/adopt a platform seeing all the benefits in productivity and developer experience it brings. At Okteto, we built a platform on top of Kubernetes which provides developers with cloud-native development environments. In this talk, I will cover what Kubernetes-based development environments are, the impact they have on developer productivity, and why we chose Kubernetes to build such a platform.

Speaker: Arsh Sharma

- 11:00 AM Talk #2

Title: Unlocking Efficiency and Collaboration: How Backstage Solves Key Developer Challenges

Abstract: This talk will explore how Backstage, an open-source developer portal platform, addresses critical challenges faced orgs. Dive into how Backstage enhances knowledge discovery, streamlines code ownership, simplifies system interfaces, automates dependency mapping, integrates tech radar, and accelerates service creation.

Speaker: Jeevan D C

- 11:30 AM Coffee/Tea Break

- 11:45 AM Talk #3

Title: Value Driven Platform Engineering Using IDPs

Abstract: This talk introduces Value-Based Platform Engineering, a paradigm that emphasizes delivering tangible business value through technical excellence. As a DevRel Engineer for Harness Internal Developer Platform (IDP) , I approach our developers as 'Customer Zero', focusing on driving platform adoption by showcasing its value in reducing routine tasks.
The heart of our strategy in the IDP is twofold: automation and visibility. By enhancing visibility, we ensure all necessary software components are easily accessible to developers, streamlining their workflow and decision-making. Concurrently, the automation aspect empowers our Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team with self-service workflows allowing them to focus on activities that enhance system reliability and performance.
In this talk, I will share how these strategies of automation and visibility have revolutionized our IDP, fostering a more productive and value-driven environment for developers and SREs.

Speaker: Debabrata Panigrahi

- 12:15 PM Talk #4

Title: Achieving API Equivalence across multiple DCs with Kong and APIOps

Abstract: This session will discuss the ideas related to deploying Kong as an external API gateway where multi-region deployments are required and API equivalence becomes a necessity to ensure uniformity across the multiple DCs.

The topics to be discussed in the session are listed as follows:

1. Overview of the problem statement - Multiple region deployments which requires API gateway's config to be uniform in order to accept API traffic consistently across all regions.

2. Brief idea about Kong, decK and APIOps - A quick primer to APIOps, Kong and managing it via declarative configurations.

3. Crafting(and explaining) the solution to maintain API equivalence across DCs:
   a. Opinionated framework to define Kong configs
   b. Manage a map of Kong control planes to be referenced based on tags.
   c. Manage upstream maps for each DC and substitute them for each APIOps workflow
   d. APIOps workflow for deploying to said Kong targets.

4. Future Scope(if time permits): Open sourcing the substitution automation library and forming the opinionated format as a standard.

Speaker: Kumar Abhijeet

- 12:45 PM Talk #5

Title: Delivering Vendor Agnostic FeatureFlags with GITOPs

Abstract: Leveraging OpenFeature for vendor agnostic FeatureFlags, Maintaning all org's feature flags in Git repo (Kustomize overlays fomat) and deploying them via GITOPs

- Demonstrating how Featureflags is a light way to do canary deployments, and the Gotchas
- Delivers changes without service restarts
- Making Feature flags part of SDLC by using GITOPs

Speaker: Rajdeep Sharma

- 01:15 PM Snacks and Open House

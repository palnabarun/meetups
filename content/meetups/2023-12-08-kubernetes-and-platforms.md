### Session Details

#### The Next Evolution of WebAssembly: The Component Model

Containers have become the established interface between your software and the platform you run on. Having a standardized interface, helps increase productivity in getting new software deployed. However, containers is a fairly low-level interface, where things like processing architectures, and operating systems are part of it.

WebAssembly is a platform neutral compilation target. With the introduction of the component model, the interface between your platform and software, is no longer tied to operating systems, and processing architectures (though container runtimes), but can include a much higher-level abstraction, e.g., an HTTP request/response platform.

This talk is about the virtues of WebAssembly as a cloud-side compute runtime. How it works under the hood, how it has support for numerous languages, how it can run on many architectures and operating systems, and how it is lightweight and blazingly fast!

#### Building a Development Platform on Top of Kubernetes

Creating cloud-native applications poses significant challenges for developers. They often feel overwhelmed during the setup of their development environments due to the multitude of components and cloud services involved.

This talk will explore the hurdles faced by developers when working on microservices-based applications and will introduce attendees to Kubernetes-based development environments as a possible solution. It will also demonstrate how platform teams can utilize open-source tools such as Okteto CLI to easily create these environments for developers.

#### Green Engineering: Environment first approach to business sustainability

In the current times how sustainability and performance engineering can have an overall impact in the way for green engineering which has overall impact on business and environment combined.

#### Faster route to DevX using Developer Portals - thanks to backstage

In today’s fast-paced world of software development, it’s important to have a robust internal developer platform (IDP) that can help your team stay productive. In this session, we will showcase the onboarding journey to quickly create and customize a Backstage-based internal developer portal on Tanzu Application Platform, freeing up time that would otherwise be spent on building and maintaining multiple DIY portals.
